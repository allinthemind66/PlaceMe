## PlaceMe

PlaceMe is a web app designed to connect people by where they have been, and where they will go. Life is a constantly unfolding story. Where will you go next?

## Motivation

This was a student project using Ruby On Rails. Me and my partner wanted to connect people based on where they have lived or visited in the past and where they will go next.
